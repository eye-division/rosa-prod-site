The fourth Gravity Fields Festival celebrating arts and science, and the area’s links to Sir Isaac Newton who grew up in Grantham, Lincolnshire.  Our 2018 theme also drew inspiration from the Lincolnshire botanist Sir Joseph Banks who travelled with Captain Cook on HMS Endeavour and gathered plants and wildlife specimens across the globe.
