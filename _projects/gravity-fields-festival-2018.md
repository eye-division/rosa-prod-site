The fourth Gravity Fields Festival celebrating arts and science, and the areaâ€™s links to Sir Isaac Newton who grew up in Grantham, Lincolnshire.&nbsp; Our 2018 theme also drew inspiration from the Lincolnshire botanist Sir Joseph Banks who travelled with Captain Cook on HMS Endeavour and gathered plants and wildlife specimens across the globe.

The biennial festival welcomes outstanding speakers and academics on science, science history, arts and related themes, and has at its centrepiece a large scale outdoor event produced and commissioned for festival with leading UK and international artists.&nbsp; Rosa Productions created the first ever Gravity Fields Festival in 2012 and has&nbsp; subsequently created and produced all four festivals, including the full science programmes and commissioned and produced all the outdoor arts programmes and has led on theming and shaping of each festival for South Kesteven District Council. &nbsp;
