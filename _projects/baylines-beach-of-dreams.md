**Bay Lines: Beach of Dreams 2023**

[**Participation Pack**](/uploads/MorecambeBay_BLBOD_72.pdf)

Join us this summer to creatively explore 120 miles of Morecambe Bay coastline.

From Fleetwood to Walney Island, Barrow, you can choose a mile to walk, celebrate and share. We’re encouraging people to discover Morecambe Bay on foot (or by bike or mobility scooter where suitable) and to join in with a collective and creative community experience.

Our aim is to gather photos, drawings and stories about 120 miles of Morecambe Bay coast and to create 120 pennants - one per mile. These pennants will then be displayed at 4 special events across the Bay over August 2023 Bank Holiday weekend. (Final deadline for Submission of content is 30 June.)

Together, we’ll be exploring the coastline and its environment, celebrating its unique landscape and examining environmental themes and the challenges of our current time by considering the question “How can we creatively reimagine our future?”

Kinetika’s Artistic Director, Ali Pretty, will lead Gathering Walks along the Bay coastline from 3 to 8 June.

You can also reserve miles to complete in your own time.&nbsp;

And if you just want to find out more we are running workshops across the Bay from 10-14 May - so join us to learn more about the project and how to take part.&nbsp; Or book direct onto the walks and art workshops.



**Bay Lines: Beach of Dreams is presented by Kinetika in partnership with Rosa Productions. It is commissioned by Morecambe Bay Partnership as part of the 'Ways Across the Bay' project which aims to inspire people to explore the Bay in low-carbon ways - on foot, bike or mobility scooter. www.waysaroundthebay.org.uk.**

**Beach of Dreams**&nbsp;began as a 500-mile walk artistically exploring the coastline of the UK in 2021.&nbsp; See more on the [Kinetika website](https://kinetika.co.uk/beach-of-dreams).&nbsp; The project was initiated by Kinetika, led by artistic director, Ali Pretty in 2021 in partnership with&nbsp;[Rosa Productions](https://www.rosaproductions.co.uk/), and will culminate in the collective UK and Ireland-wide mass participatory coastal journey in May 2025, developed by Kinetika in partnership with&nbsp;[Creative Lives](https://www.creative-lives.org/). Beach of Dreams is a multi-year exploration of the country’s coastline which began in Suffolk and Essex in 2021 and is leading towards a national project in 2025.
