### Bay Lines - Beach of Dreams

**Bay Lines is&nbsp;**a participatory programme by Kinetika in partnership with Kendal-based Rosa Productions, which will present two linked events– the first in June is an investigative Bay-wide visual arts journey and a related community, storytelling and digital project, both leading to a series of public events at the end of August.

Inspired by the ‘**Beach of Dreams&nbsp;**’ programme, initiated by Kinetika and Rosa Productions, and led by artistic director, Ali Pretty in 2021, ‘Bay Lines – Beach of Dreams’ will specifically focus on Morecambe Bay. Using cycling routes and public footpaths, Bay Lines will host artist-led ‘foraging’ walks in June to collect dye materials, images and stories from the landscape, culminating in a ‘Natural Dye’ artists’ residency between 29 July and 6 August, and workshops, led by Kinetika artist, Lesley Robinson. It will form part of the national Beach of Dreams 2025 programme which will culminate in a collective journey around 10,000 miles of coastline across the UK and Ireland, led by Kinetika and Creative Lives.

In May and June locals will be invited to share stories about each mile of coastline around the Bay, and contribute to designs for silk pennants made by Kinetika with local participants which reflect each mile of the natural environment of the coast, sands and estuaries.

Over the August bank holiday weekend four events will take place across the Bay with a finale in Morecambe, when beach installations of the pennants will form a striking display for all to enjoy alongside other outdoor ‘place-related’ performances celebrating the Bay as a place for exploration.
