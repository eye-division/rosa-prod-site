  To mark the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta we were commissioned by
  Unlock Democracy to attend and work with communities to film events across the
  UK, the filmed community,  the participation, the discussions and creative
  activity.  Short films were produced for each event for use on social media
  and web, and for documenting the overall project we produced a video which
  summarised the views and debates around proposals for a new Magna Carta.

1215 to 2015, medieval to modern, feudalism to democracy. For a document that was annulled less than 3 months after it was sealed, Magna Carta has a long and proud legacy. In the year of its 800 anniversary, Unlock Democracy are holding a series of  events across the country, both looking back at Magna Carta's place in history and looking forwards at how it could inform our political future.

We worked with Unlock Democracy and communities across the UK to film events which included seminars lectures, study groups, a theatre performances and visual arts projects, all focusing on the significance of Magna Carta, its heritage and its relevance for current constitutional reform. This national public debate about the role of Magna Carta allows modern citizens to discover the Great Charter for themselves, as well as discuss its impact on our democratic development  and political culture.
