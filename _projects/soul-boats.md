###A flotilla of golden Soul Boats in Birmingham Cathedral

As the final moment of celebration of Birmingham Cathedral’s 300th anniversary a
stunning installation of over 1,500 golden boats was suspended as a flotilla high
above the nave.  

The Soul Boats were made and decorated by communities of all faiths and backgrounds
from across the city including groups from Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Ravidassi,
Quaker and of course Christian backgrounds.  School and community groups, homeless hostels,
and arts festival audiences have also been involved in making the boats.

Birmingham Cathedral commissioned artist Jake Lever to create the installation and
the project has taken place alongside the Something Good at Birmingham Cathedral 
outdoor arts events through the summer. Jake explains the installation -

> Each boat contains a decorated story illuminating each individual’s journey through life.
> The boats will contain these private stories inside while the golden outside of the boats 
> form the flotilla.
