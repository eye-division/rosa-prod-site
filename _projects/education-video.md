Rosa Productions is working with Wiley Publishing on the production of video media for post-graduate courses at the University of Birmingham and Nottingham Trent University

Our video services include liaison with academics, planning video content with the publishers, and graphics production.

We manage the pre-production of academic content and introductory material to lecturers, filming of course content, post production of the video content and then upload for use online.
