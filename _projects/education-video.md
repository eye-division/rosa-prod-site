Rosa Productions are working with Wiley Publishing on the production of video media for post-graduate
courses at the University of Birmingham.

Currently we are providing video services for two full MBA and MPA courses which run from 2015 to 2017.

Our video services include liaison with academics, planning video content with the publishers,
and graphics production.

We manage the pre-production of academic content and introductory material to lecturers,
filming of course content, post production of the video content and then upload for use online.
