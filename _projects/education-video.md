Rosa Productions is working in partnership with Wiley Publishing on the production of video media for post-graduate courses at the University of Birmingham for MBA, MSc and Masters of Public Adminstration Courses.

We work closely with the learning and publishing teams, and with the academics, to create a range of materials to support learning.

We manage the pre-production of the academic content and introductory material, filming of course content, including interviews, case studies, learning materials, online recording of interviews with international collaborators, creation of graphics and post production of the video content.
