We worked in partnership with Wiley Education Services from 2015 to 2020 on the production of video media for post-graduate courses at the University of Birmingham for MBA, MSc and Masters of Public Administration courses.

We worked closely with the learning and publishing teams, and with the academics, to create a range of materials to support learning.

We managed the pre-production of the academic content and introductory material, filming of course content, including interviews, case studies, learning materials, online recording of interviews with international collaborators, creation of graphics and post production of the video content.
