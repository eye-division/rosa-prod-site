100 years since the Battle of the Somme, Green Fields Beyond presented the story of Lincoln 1916 when the women of the city worked as munitionettes making the world's first tanks, while the men went to war.

Green Fields Beyond was an outdoor event and procession written by Louise Page, music by Nick Bicat and with visual design from Shademakers UK.
