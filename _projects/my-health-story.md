Guy’s and St Thomas’ Charity has a focus on big health challenges that affect inner-city areas. Multiple long-term conditions are key amongst these.&nbsp; We were invited to work with the charity's community and medical health partners to help individuals tell their own video and digital stories about living with multiple conditions.<br><br>Thank you to all who took part in community groups and to those who shared their stories with us in detail: Frederick, Inacia, Jacqueline, Lesley, Lindsay, Lynda, Mario and Sue.
