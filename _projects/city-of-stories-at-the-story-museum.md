Commissioned by [The Story Museum](https://www.storymuseum.org.uk/)&nbsp;in Oxford for its 2020 Opening - the City of Stories is a&nbsp; permanent multi-screen experience for family audiences romping through 1,000 years of storytelling and story tellers in Oxford.

"Board our fantastical Story Craft and fly through a thousand years of Oxford’s story history, from ancient myths and legends to classics of children’s literature enjoyed across the world.

Climb onboard the Story Craft in the heart of a city that has inspired generations of students and scholars, writers and artists. Your flight will transport you to stories including Lewis Carroll’s&nbsp;*Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland*, C S Lewis’s*&nbsp;Chronicles of Narnia*, J R R Tolkien’s&nbsp;*The Lord of the Rings*&nbsp;and Philip Pullman’s&nbsp;*His Dark Materials*. Powered by your imagination, our Story Craft can soar above the famous skyline, along winding streets and lazy waterways, and travel back in time, down rabbit holes and through windows into other worlds."

This is the perfect introduction to Oxford’s literary history. Collect your boarding pass now.
