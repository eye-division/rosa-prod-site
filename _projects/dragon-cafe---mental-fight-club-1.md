description: "The film is a powerful advocate for the work of Mental Fight Club and its SE London and City of London based project The Dragon Café. It shows the arts activities of the Café, particularly the choir and the singing project and hears from interviews patrons who rely on the activities for their wellbeing.\_\n\nThe video shows how wellbeing and creative projects can have a major impact on our lives and health – particularly through offering creative outlets.\n\nThe film takes inspiration from words of Ben Okri the Patron of the Dragon Cafe and the Mental Fight Club\n\n“You can’t remake the world without remaking yourself.\_Each new era begins within. It is an inward event, With unsuspected possibilities For inner liberation. We\_could\_use it to turn on Our inward lights. We\_could\_use it to use even the dark And negative things positively. We\_could\_use the new era To clean our eyes, To see the\_world\_differently, To see ourselves more clearly.”"
