The film is a powerful advocate for the work of Mental Fight Club and its SE London and City of London based project The Dragon Caf&eacute;. It shows the arts activities of the Caf&eacute;, particularly the choir and the singing project and hears from interviews patrons who rely on the activities for their wellbeing.&nbsp;

The video shows how wellbeing and creative projects can have a major impact on our lives and health â€“ particularly through offering creative outlets.

The film takes inspiration from words of Ben Okri the Patron of the Dragon Cafe and the Mental Fight Club

"**You can't remake the world without remaking yourself.** Each new era begins within. It is an inward event, With unsuspected possibilities For inner liberation. We&nbsp;**could**&nbsp;use it to turn on Our inward lights. We&nbsp;**could**&nbsp;use it to use even the dark And negative things positively. We&nbsp;**could**&nbsp;use the new era To clean our eyes, To see the&nbsp;**world**&nbsp;differently, To see ourselves more clearly."
