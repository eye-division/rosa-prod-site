Producer Rosemary Richards worked with Artistic Director Orit Azaz to produce Birmingham Cathedral's &nbsp;300th anniversary arts celebrations in 2015 commissioning a multi-faith group of artists to work together to produce an outdoor event in Cathedral Square and an installation in the Cathedral. &nbsp;Something Good and Soul Boats involved many communities and faith groups across Birmingham.

Something Good was led by artistic director Orit Aziz with composer Dan Jones, and artists Mohammed Ali, Mandy Rose and artist Jake Lever worked alongside the team to present the installation Soul Boats. Both events reflected the diverse and multi faith nature of the city.&nbsp; In the lead up to the October events Mohammed &nbsp;Ali’s Nomad tour visited Erdington, Sparkhill, Handsworth, King’s Heath and Longbridge.

Supported by Arts Council England, Birmingham City Council and the Jerusalem Trust.
