Birmingham Cathedral celebrated its 300th anniversary in 2015 with a multi-faith group 
of artists involving many communities and faith groups across Birmingham in a summer 
of outdoor arts leading to an event in Cathedral Square. 

Something Good was led by artistic director Orit Aziz with composer Dan Jones, and artists
Mohammed Ali, Mandy Rose and Jake Lever. It reflected the diverse and multi faith people of the city.Â 
In the lead up to the October events Mohammed's Nomad tour visited Erdington, Sparkhill, 
Handsworth, King's Heath and Longbridge.

Supported by Arts Council England, Birmingham City Council and the Jerusalem Trust.
