Clay Live 2013 was a series of pottery talks, demonstrations and exhibitions organised
by a consortium including The Oxford Ceramics Gallery, The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford,
and supported by Margaret O'Rorke and the Craft Potters Association.

Rosa Productions produced at least 3 videos relating to each of the Clay Live potters, 
Mo Jupp, Geoffrey Swindell, Sutton Taylor and Walter Keeler. First a short visual introduction
to the artist in Oxford, then interviews and practical demonstrations.

Clay Live was filmed by Rosa Productions in partnership with About Vision and Jamodo Media.
The filming was supported by the Helen Hamlyn Trust.
