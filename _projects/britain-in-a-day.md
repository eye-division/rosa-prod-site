Rosa Productions were commissioned by BBC Learning to work alongside their Learningteam and the main film producers Scott Free London, to support and encourage video productionby members of the public for the BBC2 feature film, Britain in a Day, which was all self-shot.

We ran 30 workshops around the UK which were delivered in partnership with local organisations.Around 450 workshop participants took part in film-making workshops with the aim of them filmingtheir day in November 2011 and uploading their video to YouTube for possible inclusion in the final film.And some of our films made it into the final cut including fell runners in Derbyshire,participants in the Lord Mayorâ€™s Parade and community participants up and down the country.

We also worked with BBC Learning to communicate the opportunity through social media and bysupplying local radio and regional TV with filming opportunities.  We organised 18 broadcastreports on the project through the UK. We worked with a wide variety of groups including a Polish community group in Newcastle, Chinese communities in London, a group of young men in the St Pauls district of Bristol, Action Hearing Loss in Northern Ireland and film-makers with disabilities in Oxford.
