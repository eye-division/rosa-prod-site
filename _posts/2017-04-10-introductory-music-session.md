Introductory Music Sessions

**Sunday 7<sup>th</sup>Â May:****2pm-5pm**

**St Mary's Church Hall, New Road, Greenham, RG19 8RZ**

Music and singing will play a strong part throughout this performance and we would love as many groups and individuals to be involved as much as possible. There will be three main songs for choirs to learn for part of the main event. Music will also be involved during the preshow elements of the day so there are plenty of opportunities to get involved.

If you are interested in coming along to this meeting please email laura@rosaproductions.co.uk for more details.
