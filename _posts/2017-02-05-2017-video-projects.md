We are very busy working with Wiley Publishing on video production for University of 
Birmingham and University of Nottingham post-graduate courses. We are currently producing 
video for 9 Modules of work – So far in January we have produced around 300 short videos 
involving content from across the UK, tailored to work as an educational resource for 
postgraduate online students across the world.

Content varies from MBA courses, to Construction Project Management and International Relations.
