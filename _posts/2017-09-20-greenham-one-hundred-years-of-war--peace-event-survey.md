Around 5000 turned up to watch the final curtain call for Greenham: 100 Years of War and Peace. Greenham: 100 Years of War and Peace was a large scale outdoor event celebrating 20 years of the Greenham Trust. On the evenings of the 8th and 9th September 2017 the story of Greenham Common came alive through an amazing spectacle of performance, songs, light projections and live art. Did you attend the event?
