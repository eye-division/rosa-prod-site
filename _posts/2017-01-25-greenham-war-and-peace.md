Production has started for a large scale outdoor event event on Greenham Common to
take place on 8/9 September 2017, celebrating 20 years of the Greenham Common Trust,
which has been supporting communities in the area since taking over the management of
the site and returning the runway to common land.

If you would like to take part in the project please email us at
[admin@rosaproductions.co.uk](admin@rosaproductions.co.uk) or see the Greenham Common 
Trust site for more information on
[performing and volunteering opportunities](http://www.greenham-common-trust.co.uk/greenham-war-and-peace).

Whether you were with the USAF or worked for the British services, or were part of the 
peace protests, we would like to hear your story. We are also interested in the history
of nature on the common and stretching back to centuries gone by and previous battles, 
the time of the Civil War and earlier, so local historians please do come forward.

We are hoping to involve hundreds of local people of all ages in largely outdoor events
and would love to hear from you, or your community group.
