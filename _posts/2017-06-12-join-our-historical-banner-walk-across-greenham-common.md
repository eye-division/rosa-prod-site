Saturday 1st July 2017

Internationally acclaimed artist Ali Pretty invites you to help retrace the history of Greenham Common on Saturday 1st July. As part of Greenham: 100 Years of War and Peace the local community have produced a series of 10 giant commemorative silk banners, each depicting different periods of the commonâ€™s history. Join us as we walk across the common with these beautiful banners and make connections with the landscape and its amazing history and wildlife.

The day will involve two different walks across the common both starting at the Control Tower. Parking is available at the Control Tower (34 Burys Bank Rd, Thatcham RG19 8BZ). You can join the morning, the afternoon or the entire day. Please wear sensible footwear and bring a picnic lunch.
